\# Week-3



\## What Did We Do?



This week we annotated the dataset we are working on and made the train - validation split YOLO requires.



\## How Did We Do It?



We chose the top 9 US Aircrafts and labeled ~9000 image. The labeling was done automatically with a python script that labeled the whole image. This worked because the dataset we are using consists of cropped images that only contain aircrafts or parts of them.



\## Files and Deliverables



The python script we uploaded loads the data from Kaggle, unzips, organizes, labels and splits it.

You have to create the dataset.yaml file whose content is given at the end of our python script.
