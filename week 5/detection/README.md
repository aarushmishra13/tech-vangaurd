# Week-5



## What Did We Do?



We fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model on the whole dataset.



## How Did We Do It?



We found out that the dataset we used already had labeled images. The label files were in csv. We converted those files to txt for YOLO and adjusted the Dataset. Later, we trained the YOLOv8 model on the whole dataset - 80+ aircraft types. We initially trained the model on 20 epochs, when we saw that it was still advancing we trained another 20 epochs.



\## Files \& Deliverables



The training scripts and best model have been uploaded to the directory alongside results charts.
